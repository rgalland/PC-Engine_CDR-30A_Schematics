This repository contains reverse engineering information regarding the PC-Engine CD-ROM2.

It started with the schematics of the main and front PCBs but has now evolve to provide reproduction parts. In the schematics, I attempted to highlight the differences between the CDR-30 (older models) and the CDR-30A but I have even found PCB differences within the newer CDR-30A units. Main difference is the use of the Sony DSP CXD1135 + external RAM as opposed to CXD1167 without additional RAM.
Currently available reproduction parts are the 2 flexible PCBs on the KSS-220A laser module. These are not compatible with the KSS-162A found mainly on older units. The main PCB is at the prototype level at the moment.

You will need kicad to work with files but I also provide pdf files to view the schematics in a more convenent way.
